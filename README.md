# Fabrio-Task

## Object Comparison Toolkit
### Overview
This repository contains a Python toolkit for comparing objects, primarily designed for evaluating the similarity between 3D models or datasets. The toolkit includes functions for calculating the percentage match and providing a detailed breakdown of correctness for different components, such as volume, bounding box coordinates, and faces.

### Features
1. The toolkit calculates the percentage match between a target object and an attempt object, considering various attributes.
2. Provides a detailed breakdown of correctness for volume, bounding box coordinates, and individual faces.
3. Breaks down correctness for each face, including bounding box coordinates, centroid, and area.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
2. Run the provided example using python task.py with the JSON files in the same directory.
